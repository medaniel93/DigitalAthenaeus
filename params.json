{"name":"Digital Athenaeus","tagline":"A new digital edition of Athenaeus' Deipnosophists","body":"The [Digital Athenaeus](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/projects/open-greek-and-latin-project/digital-athenaeus/) is a project of the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig. The aim of the project is to produce a true digital edition of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus of Naucratis with multiple versions of the work and translations in multiple languages. The Deipnosophists (Δειπνοσοφισταί, or Sophists at Dinner, in fifteen books), written by Athenaeus of Naucratis in the early 3rd century AD, is the fictitious account of several banquet conversations on food, literature, and arts held in Rome by twenty-two learned men. This complex and fascinating work is not only an erudite and literary encyclopedia of a myriad of curiosities about classical antiquity, but also an invaluable collection of quotations of ancient authors, ranging from Homer to tragic and comic poets and lost historians. Since the large majority of the works cited by Athenaeus is nowadays lost, this compilation is a sort of reference tool for every scholar of Greek theater, poetry, historiography, botany, zoology, and many other topics.\r\n\r\n##[athenaeus-dev](http://opengreekandlatin.github.io/athenaeus-dev/)\r\nMachine-corrected versions of the works of Athenaeus of Naucratis, Greek rhetorician and grammarian.\r\n\r\n##[treebank-data](https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/DigitalAthenaeus/tree/master/treebank-data)\r\nThis repository contains XML treebank files of the Greek text of Athenaeus' Deipnosophists produced by Vanessa and Bob Gorman (University of Nebraska-Lincoln).
